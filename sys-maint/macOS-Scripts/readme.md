# The One-Liner (empties the Dock's app side)


## 🧹 Want to clear the right side too (folders/stacks like Downloads)?

Chain both arrays in a single command:

````
Shelldefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array; defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array; killall DockShow more lines
````

The persistent-others key controls the folders/stacks section on the right of the divider.
